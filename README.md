# Centipede
A recreation of the 1980's Atari Centipede Arcade Game in c++.

In the current state this project CANNOT BE RUN. This is because I did not include the SMFL External Libraries in the project. Theoretically it should work if you were to download and link up the smfl library. 
This project best serves as a demonstration of design patterns such as Factories, Singletons, Listeners, etc. 

Feel free to browse the files to get a feeling for my programming style (that being said I wrote this in 2016 and since my skills have 
improved steadily).
